                    Once leaving my career as a dancer behind me, I embarked on a career in technology. I started with online courses and then 
                    joined a bootcamp. It's not been easy, but luckily, the grit and determination that I built for myself
                    as a dancer have paid off. 
                </p>
            </div>
        )
    }
