                I am a software developer based in London, I originally trained as a dancer and then 
                decided to retrain in software. I joined a bootcamp for full stack developers which was 
                by no means easy, I learnt Java and JavaScript. There have been multiple occasions where I have wanted to throw my code 
                out of the window, however, that feeling when you solve a problem and can stand back and say 
                "I built that" is a feeling that money can't buy (I will however accept money for it - if your offering ;) ).
